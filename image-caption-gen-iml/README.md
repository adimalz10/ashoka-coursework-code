# Image Caption Generation using ArtEmis

This repository contains the code for the final project of the Introduction to Machine Learning course.

The objective of the project is to use two tools, CNN + LSTM and a transformer to generate captions for images. The training dataset used was the ArtEmis dataset that itself uses around 80000 images from WikiArt to make captions and store information about the emotion and art style of each painting.
